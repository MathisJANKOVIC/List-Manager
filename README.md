# List-Manager

List Manager is a python console-based application created to simplify the creation and management of various types of lists. It supports a variety of operations such as adding or removing items, clearing or deleting entire lists, and saving lists for future use. This application can handle different kinds of lists, including but not limited to shopping lists and to-do lists.

The program comes with an interactive menu, powered by `python-cli-menu`, my brand new module, which allows you to navigate using directional arrows and to select an option by pressing the enter key.
